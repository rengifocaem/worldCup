# worldCup
  We chose to do this project on the World Cup as we were in the midst of the defining matches of the world cup. The constant viewing of the matches at work, at home, on Bart had us curious about the players and general quality of the teams. We mainly used Plotly and Seaborn in Python to generate visualizations related to the players and countries that participated.

  While I didn't know much about the sport I did learn that the players are diverse in their physical attributes, allowing greater participation. I also learned that Europe tends to have the best clubs and have players from all over the world gravitating to them. The best and worst clubs ended up having players from their own countries (the worst might be due to lack of other opportunities).
